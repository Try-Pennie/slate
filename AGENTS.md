# Git workflow: never reuse a merged PR branch

PRs here are reviewed and **merged within seconds**, then auto-deploy. So a
follow-up commit pushed to a branch whose PR already merged gets **stranded** —
it never reaches main. Always start new work on a **fresh branch off `origin/main`**
(`git checkout -b <name> origin/main`); to continue work after a PR merges,
branch fresh and cherry-pick. A `pre-push` hook (`.githooks/pre-push`, enabled by
the `prepare` script) blocks pushing onto an already-merged/closed PR branch;
override only when intentional with `ALLOW_MERGED_PUSH=1`.

The same hook also runs CI's fast checks before every push — `tsc --noEmit`,
`pnpm lint`, and `pnpm test` (the unit suite, which includes the copy/dash lint
and the migration invariants) — so a CI-only failure is caught locally instead
of breaking main after merge. It's ~10s on a clean tree; skip it in a pinch with
`SKIP_PREPUSH_CHECKS=1`. The heavy Cloudflare build stays in CI.

# Screenshotting the dev UI (Playwright/Peekaboo)

Screenshots against `next dev` hang and time out — element shots wait forever on
CSS animations to "settle" (the `.pn-*` entrance/pulse keyframes never do), and
full-page shots stall on font loading. Before capturing, freeze motion by
injecting this style via `browser_evaluate`, then take the shot:

```js
const s = document.createElement('style');
s.textContent = '*,*::before,*::after{animation:none!important;transition:none!important;scroll-behavior:auto!important;caret-color:transparent!important}';
document.head.appendChild(s);
```

A JPEG capture also succeeds where PNG times out. Save outside the repo root
(or delete after) so stray images aren't committed.
